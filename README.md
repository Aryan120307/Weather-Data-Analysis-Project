# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis & Rainfall Insights

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical weather data to understand
the relationship between different weather parameters and rainfall.

The analysis is performed using Python and popular data analysis libraries.

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following weather attributes:
- Temperature (Min & Max)
- Humidity (9am & 3pm)
- Pressure (9am & 3pm)
- Wind speed and direction
- Rainfall amount
- RainToday and RainTomorrow

Note: The dataset does not contain time-series information.
